\section*{Introduction}

This document describes the algorithm for averaging a set of points in 3D space, considering their uncertainties and covariance matrices. Each point has associated uncertainties represented by a \(3 \times 3\) covariance matrix. The algorithm calculates the weighted average of the points and the combined covariance matrix.

\section*{Input Data}

The input consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of points \(\mathbf{p}_i\), where each point \(\mathbf{p}_i\) is a vector \(\begin{pmatrix} x_i \\ y_i \\ z_i \end{pmatrix}\).
    \item A list of covariance matrices \(\Sigma_i\), where each \(\Sigma_i\) is a \(3 \times 3\) matrix representing the uncertainties of the corresponding point \(\mathbf{p}_i\).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Algorithm}

\subsection*{Step 1: Inverse Covariance Matrices}

For each covariance matrix \(\Sigma_i\), calculate the inverse matrix \(W_i\):
\[
W_i = \Sigma_i^{-1}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Combined Covariance Matrix}

Calculate the combined covariance matrix \(\Sigma_{\text{combined}}\) using the sum of the inverse covariance matrices:
\[
\Sigma_{\text{combined}} = \left( \sum_{i} W_i \right)^{-1}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Weighted Sum of Points}

Calculate the weighted sum of the points:
\[
\mathbf{p}_{\text{weighted\_sum}} = \sum_{i} W_i \mathbf{p}_i
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Averaged Point}

Calculate the averaged point \(\mathbf{p}_{\text{avg}}\) using the combined covariance matrix and the weighted sum of points:
\[
\mathbf{p}_{\text{avg}} = \Sigma_{\text{combined}} \mathbf{p}_{\text{weighted\_sum}}
\]

\section*{Summary}

This algorithm provides a method to average 3D points considering their uncertainties, represented by covariance matrices. By using the inverse of the covariance matrices as weights, the algorithm ensures that points with lower uncertainty have a higher influence on the final averaged point. The combined covariance matrix represents the overall uncertainty of the averaged point.
